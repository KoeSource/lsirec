<div class="infobox"><p><strong>Update</strong>: I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/marcan/lsirec">new tool</a> that lets you
do most of this process from Linux, without rebooting and without needing any
UEFI or DOS tools, which should work for any LSI SAS2008 card regardless of
vendor and let you crossflash to any firmware.</p>
</div>

<p>I own a Fujitsu Primergy server (hosted at a secret location ;-) ) that I use
for offsite backups and a few misc things (and for which it’s, incidentally,
grossly overpowered). It came with a Fujitsu D2607 RAID controller, which is
based on the LSI SAS2008 (“Falcon”) chipset. Unfortunately, its firmware is
old and only barely supports drives in JBOD mode with some issues  (I want to
use software RAID 5), and also does not support drives larger than 2TB.</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>One chip, many faces</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Interestingly, LSI uses the same SAS2008 chipset on both their higher-end RAID
cards and lower-end SAS HBAs. There are, in fact, two different classes of
devices, with completely different Linux drivers, that are implemented using the
same chip: MegaRAID/iMR (the full-featured hardware managed RAID solution) and
MPT2SAS (a simpler device which comes in two firmware variants: IR, with support
for basic hardware RAID0/1/10, and IT, which is just a plain HBA with no RAID
support). I use two SAS disks in hardware RAID1 as boot drives, and four SATA
disks in software RAID5 as data drives, so I’m interested in the IR mode
firmware, which has good support for passing through plain drives straight to
the OS but still lets me have a hardware RAID1 volume to boot off of.</p>

<p>There is in fact quite a bit of documentation on how these LSI-based cards can
be “crossflashed” to different firmware versions, from different vendors and in
different modes. Unfortunately, most of this documentation is of the form
“download these random tools and run them in this order, worked for
me!“—nobody seems to have done any serious analysis. There are over half a
dozen tools potentially involved depending on which mode you’re coming from and
going to, and countless firmware variants. Some tools only work with some
firmwares, and the tools themselves are available for different combinations of
DOS, Windows, UEFI, and Linux, depending on which tool and which version you
stumble across.</p>

<p>Even more unfortunately, the Fujitsu card seems to be a bit oddball, with only
a few people reporting a successful crossflash, and that involving a really
bizarre dance through 3 different firmwares. I tried it, and it certainly didn’t
work for me. So I ditched all of that and made it work the right way. Here’s
how.</p>

<h2 id="lsi-firmware-basics">LSI firmware basics</h2>

<p>First things first: one nice thing about these cards is that you can’t brick
them, as long as your BIOS lets you turn off Option ROM loading. Low-level
recovery is always possible. Just make sure you write down your SAS address
before starting, as you’ll have to write that back if you wipe and flash from
scratch.</p>

<p>There are actually 3 different types of nonvolatile memory on these cards:
there is an “SBR”, which is actually just a serial EEPROM containing the core
information about the card (but no actual firmware). Then there is the main
Flash memory, which contains both the firmware that runs on the card (it has
a PowerPC CPU) and the Option ROM that runs on the host, as well as other misc
bits. Finally, there is an nvSRAM
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoresistive_random-access_memory">MRAM memory</a>,
the modern descendant of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory">core memory</a>!) that holds
settings and buffers.</p>

<p>To crossflash a card to a different firmware, you first need to write the SBR
corresponding to the type of card that you want (iMR or IT/IR). Then you
can wipe the flash memory and flash whatever firmware you need.</p>

<h2 id="sbr-flashing">SBR flashing</h2>

<p>To flash the SBR, the only tool available seems to be a small DOS binary called
<code>megarec.exe</code>. This tool works on a “dead” card, and doesn’t care whether the
card is in iMR or IT/IR mode.</p>

<p>Supermicro actually provide tools and documentation on how to crossflash their
SAS2008 based cards between MegaRAID and IT/IR modes, so I recommend going to
<a href="http://www.supermicro.com/support/faqs/faq.cfm?faq=13612">their page</a> if you
need to get ahold of <code>megarec.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this does mean you need to put together a FreeDOS USB boot disk
or similar. I recommend <a href="http://www.chtaube.eu/computers/freedos/bootable-usb/">these</a>
prebuilt bootable USB images if you just want something ready to go. Picking the
HIMEMX boot config works best.</p>

<p>You should probably back up your SBR first (which, by the way, also contains
your SAS address):</p>

<pre><code>megarec -readsbr 0 sbr-bak.bin
</code></pre>

<p>Then write the new SBR:</p>

<pre><code>megarec -writesbr 0 sbr.bin
</code></pre>

<p>Wiping the flash is recommended at this point:</p>

<pre><code>megarec -cleanflash 0
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that didn’t work for me: it only wiped half of the flash (8 out
of 16MB) before erroring out. My guess is that this version of <code>megarec</code> doesn’t
properly support my Flash chip. However, this doesn’t seem to cause major
issues; presumably, wiping the first half of flash is more than enough to make
sure no remnant firmware is running and the card comes up in a clean state.</p>

<p>So what SBR should you use? At first I used the Supermicro <code>SBRIR.BIN</code>, but
keep reading. What is critical is that you pick an SBR for the correct mode of
your card: an iMR one if you want full MegaRAID mode, or an IT/IR one if you
just want the MPT2SAS mode. The SBR determines which mode the card comes up in,
and its PCI ID which identifies it to the host as one or the other kind.</p>

<p>As we’ll see, though, the SBR isn’t nearly as mysterious as you might assume,
judging by the fact that they get tossed around but nobody seems to have
bothered to throw one in a hex editor yet. But I’m getting ahead of myself…</p>

<h2 id="firmware-flashing">Firmware flashing</h2>

<p>Here’s where it gets all over the place. There are different firmware flashing
tools depending on which mode you’re in (iMR or IT/IR), and which OS you use.
I’ll be discussing only the IT/IR flash tool, which is called <code>sas2flash</code>.</p>

<p>I tried a bunch, but what worked best for me was the UEFI version. The DOS ones
wouldn’t work due to some missing BIOS functionality in my UEFI BIOS, while
the Linux ones only work if the card is already functional, not if it has been
wiped (since they rely on the kernel driver to talk to the card, and that won’t
come up if the card is dead).</p>

<p>I used the P19 version of the LSI <code>sas2flash.efi</code> tool. To use it, boot into an
EFI shell with the tools on a FAT32 formatted disk (e.g. USB drive), and:</p>

<pre><code>cd fs0:
sas2flash.efi -o -f 2118ir.bin -b mptsas2.rom
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>2118ir.bin</code> is the firmware that you want to flash (I used the P19
IR firmware from LSI), and mptsas2.rom is the Option ROM (I used version
07.19.00.00 of the standard BIOS ROM, but I’ll probably try an UEFI version next
time I get a chance to mess with the server, see how that works).</p>

<p>Then you should write back the original SAS address:</p>

<pre><code>sas2flsh -o -sasadd 5000112233445566
</code></pre>

<p>At first, I had issues getting this to work at all: the UEFI versions would
detect the card and attempt to boot it, but fail. However, I think I was hitting
a strange interaction with my board’s UEFI implementation. I was doing this on
a consumer miniITX board, not the server, since the server takes ages to boot,
but consumer hardware probably has a less reliable UEFI implementation. I
eventually discovered that booting FreeDOS, flashing the SBR with <code>megarec</code>,
using Ctrl-Alt-Delete to warm-reboot, and going to a UEFI shell would allow
<code>sas2flash.efi</code> to boot the card properly properly (but only once, I had to
reboot and repeat the process for subsequent invocations).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, here I hit the first issue with flashing this Fujitsu card, which
other people had also reported:</p>

<pre><code>Chip is in RESET state. Attempting Host Boot...
Firmware Host Boot Successful.

Mfg Page 2 Mismatch Detected.
Writing Current Mfg Page 2 Settings to NVRAM.
Failed to Validate Mfg Page 2!
</code></pre>

<p>This is what someone purportedly worked around by using a strange combination
of tools and firmwares, which didn’t work for me, but we can do better. What is
this <em>Mfg Page 2</em>? I have no idea. Why is it validating it? There should be
nothing to validate, as I’m flashing the card from scratch. This sounds like
an attempt to prevent crossflashing by making sure that e.g. the vendor ID does
not change.</p>

<h2 id="hacking-sas2flash">Hacking sas2flash</h2>

<p>So instead of trying to come up with a Rube-Goldberg solution as seems to be
popular with these LSI cards, I threw <code>sas2flash.efi</code> into IDA. It took 5
minutes to find the function responsible for the <code>Mfg Page 2</code> message (via
string search) and patch out the check. Interestingly, <code>sas2flash.efi</code> is
compiled into EFI Byte Code (EBC), a platform-independent bytecode architecture,
so it should work for both 32-bit and 64-bit EFI implementations. This didn’t
really make it any harder to patch, though: IDA can disassemble EBC, and the
patch was so obvious I didn’t even need to look up the EBC instruction encodings
to work out what to patch.</p>

</pre>

<p>With that patch, the flashing process completed successfully (actually, I had
to run it again after a reboot to get the BIOS flashed, probably due to the
aforementioned UEFI issues). Grab the patched <code>sas2flash.efi</code>
<a href="https://marcan.st/posts/lsi/sas2hax.efi">here</a>.</p>

<p>Victory! Time to stick the card back into the server, plug the SFF connectors
back in, and boot. Except… turns out the card only sees 3 drives. One
connector’s worth. The other connector is dead. This was also reported as an
issue by someone. They hadn’t managed to Rube-Goldberg their way out of this
one.</p>

<p>I had a hunch here. One connector working and not the other one is a bit
strange. The chip only has 8 ports, and they are connected straight to the
connectors with no intervening logic. There is nothing “special” that the
Fujitsu card can possibly require to enable both connectors. However, sometimes,
high-speed interfaces like these have configuration bits that do things like
flip the polarity of the signal lines, or rearrange them in some way. It’s
possible that the Fujitsu card requires a slightly different config. What’s
that SBR all about, anyway?</p>

<h2 id="demystifying-the-sbr">Demystifying the SBR</h2>

<p>What <em>is</em> inside that SBR? It’s only 256 bytes. Is it secret boot code?
Encrypted information? Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin wallet?</p>

<p>Turns out comparing a few SBRs you can find around is enough to deduce the interesting
bits.</p>

backed up… including that lone little mystery
<span class="yellow">yellow</span> byte, which was 04 in the Fujitsu SBR, but
07 in every other SBR I’d seen. Could this be the magic fix for the connector
issue? Only one way to find out: patch up the SBR (both copies), fix the
checksum, write it with <code>megarec</code>, and see what happens.</p>

<p>Did it work? You bet. All drives detected. Victory.</p>

<p>Grab the patched SBR <a href="https://marcan.st/posts/lsi/sbrfj.bin">here</a>. This one keeps the Fujitsu
